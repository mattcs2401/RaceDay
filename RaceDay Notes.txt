Based on the URL (example):
https://api.beta.tab.com.au/v1/tab-info-service/racing/dates/2023-10-03/meetings?jurisdiction=QLD

Notes:
1. jurisdiction=QLD seems to be ignored but errors if it's not there ?
e.g. {"error":{"details":[{"path":"query.jurisdiction","message":"should be NSW, VIC, ACT, QLD, SA, NT or TAS"}],"code":"INVALID_SYNTAX_ERROR","message":"Invalid query string"}}

2. HTTP response codes:
   200 - OK
   400 - Bad request, e.g. Url incorrect.
   404 - Not found.
   General network timeouts?

=======
Issues:
=======
-> Race time value in the raw data is not always correct:
e.g. 20/10/2023 Gatton (GTN) Race 1 raceStartTime 2023-10-20T02:14:00.000
     Should be 12:14.

-> Got a lot of "_state.emit(state.value)", this really necessary ??


==========
1st TO DO:
==========
--> Alarm
    Turn off alarm if no Summaries to notify.
    -- What if a new Summary item subsequently added ?

--> Scratching
    Scratchings to end of the list ?
    Notes:
    -- The list of scratchings are part of the RaceDto data and the Scratching table is populated as
       part of the Meeting/Race setup.
    -- The RunnerWorker then marries up Scratching details to the Runner metadata 'isScratched'
       (if/as applicable).
    -- Currently the Runners screen does the sort, but should try to move this out ? to . . ?

------------
Other TO DO:
------------
--> General
    Use Date() or equivalent instead of converting to/from millis.

--> Create/save a "cache" to emit into the flow when an exception occurs.
    i.e. getting data but an exception occurs so just reload existing data.

--> Better use of SavedStateHandle. Refer Point 2 of:
    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfCivo5qJkI

--> Race time in the Summary is displaying incorrectly for evening/night races.
   -> Manually check data from API ?

--> App refresh value where all the data is refreshed, i.e from Api ?
   -> at a certain interval ?
      -> coroutine worker with delay start probably good choice here
   -> manual option ?
   -> what about existing Summary detail
      -> don't touch or
      -> rebuild, how ?

--> Better error notification back to Splash screen.
    -> some work done.

--> Better error notification from Worker back to ... ?

--------------
Notifications:
--------------

-> New notification adds to the list of others there:
   -> Pops up for a few seconds on initial display (heads up ?).
   -> Don't want sound.

-> Need a notification actions button:
   -> go to ... ?
