Based on the URL (example):
https://api.beta.tab.com.au/v1/tab-info-service/racing/dates/2023-10-03/meetings?jurisdiction=QLD

Notes:
1. jurisdiction=QLD seems to be ignored but errors if it's not there ?
e.g. {"error":{"details":[{"path":"query.jurisdiction","message":"should be NSW, VIC, ACT, QLD, SA, NT or TAS"}],"code":"INVALID_SYNTAX_ERROR","message":"Invalid query string"}}

2. HTTP response codes:
   200 - OK
   400 - Bad request, e.g. Url incorrect.
   404 - Not found.
   General network timeouts?

=======
Issues:
=======
-> Race time value in the raw data is not always correct:
e.g. 20/10/2023 Gatton (GTN) Race 1 raceStartTime 2023-10-20T02:14:00.000
     Should be 12:14.

-> Got a lot of "_state.emit(state.value)", this really necessary ??


==================================
= TO DO:
==================================

--> Something that indicates a bet has been made for a Summary item.
--> A refresh button ?


--> Race time in the Summary is displaying incorrectly for evening/night races.
   -> Manually check data from API ?

--> App refresh value where all the data is refreshed, i.e from Api ?
   -> at a certain interval ?
      -> coroutine worker with delay start probably good choice here
   -> manual option ?
   -> what about existing Summary detail
      -> don't touch or
      -> rebuild, how ?

--> Better error notification back to Splash screen.
    -> some work done.

--> Better error notification from Worker back to ... ?


--------------
Notifications:
--------------

-> Alarm is inexact repeating every 5 ? minutes (while the Summary is populated).

-> Don't start until after the Summary is populated.

-> New notification adds to the list of others there:
   -> Pops up for a few seconds on initial display.
   -> Don't want sound.

-> Need a notification actions button:
   -> go to ... ?
