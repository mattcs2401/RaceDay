Based on the URL (example):
https://api.beta.tab.com.au/v1/tab-info-service/racing/dates/2023-10-03/meetings?jurisdiction=QLD

Notes:
1. jurisdiction=QLD seems to be ignored but errors if it's not there ?
e.g. {"error":{"details":[{"path":"query.jurisdiction","message":"should be NSW, VIC, ACT, QLD, SA, NT or TAS"}],"code":"INVALID_SYNTAX_ERROR","message":"Invalid query string"}}

2. HTTP response codes:
   200 - OK
   400 - Bad request, e.g. Url incorrect.
   404 - Not found.
   General network timeouts?
